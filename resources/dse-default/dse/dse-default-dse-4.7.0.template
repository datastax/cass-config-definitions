# additional libraries.  It is formatted as a colon-delimited list of
# class directories and/or jar files.  For example, to enable the
# JMX-to-web bridge install libmx4j-java and uncomment the following.
#EXTRA_CLASSPATH="/usr/share/java/mx4j-tools.jar"

# have an effect the first time a cluster is started with HADOOP_ENABLED=1 and
# after that will be a no-op. Defaults to 1.
